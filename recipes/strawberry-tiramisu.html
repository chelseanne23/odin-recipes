    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Strawberry Tiramisu</em>, my favorite summer dessert, is a sweet and
      visually appealing treat loved by all. It consists of layers of
      vanilla-infused mascarpone, strawberry jam-soaked ladyfingers, and plenty
      of fresh strawberries! This summer variation of the famous Italian dessert
      omits alcohol, raw eggs, and coffee, ensuring that everyone can indulge in
      its flavors!
    </p>
    <p>
      This no-bake delight is an excellent choice for your next summer event,
      whether served in a baking dish or individual glasses. It can also be
      prepared ahead of time, allowing the ladyfingers to fully absorb the
      strawberry mixture and achieve a softer texture. After a day of
      refrigeration, it reaches its peak of deliciousness!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/3 cup strawberry jam</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water, (or prosecco)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp balsamic vinegar, (or lemon juice)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>1 cup mascarpone cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 cups sliced strawberries, (1 pint)</li>
      <li>24 ladyfingers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, combine mascarpone cheese, cream, sugar, and vanilla
        extract.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat with an electric mixer or stand mixer on medium-high speed for 1 to
        1 1/2 minutes until smooth and thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, combine strawberry preserves, water, and balsamic
        vinegar. Stir with a fork until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip the ladyfingers in the mixture to coat them. Line the ladyfingers in
        a single layer, in the bottom of a 8”x 8” or similarly sized baking
        dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers and layer
        with half of the sliced strawberries. Repeat with the remaining
        ladyfingers, mascarpone mixture, and sliced strawberries.
      </li>
      <li>Cover with cling wrap and chill at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
    </ol>
